## AWS Commands

### My command isn't recognised and I got the following error, how do I get it to work?

- Example error message

```bash
aws: error: argument operation: Invalid Choice
```

- When copying and pasting commands from Github viewed on a browser, the formatting can result in the command not being recognised in your terminal.

- We recommend you try to copy and paste the command from your code editor instead e.g. Visual Studio Code, Notepad++ etc.

- While you're learning, we encourage you to type commands out by hand so that you can reinforce your knowledge a bit better.

## Terraform

### Terraform apply produced an error, what can I try next?

- If you get an error during `terraform apply`, let's determine if it's just a one-off issue or does the command fail consistently in the same place i.e. can you reproduce the error messages?

- Run `terraform apply` again to see what outcome you get.

- You can also try to run `terraform destroy` first and then run `terraform apply` again.

### How do I remove Terraform's state to start afresh again?

- When you want a blank slate to work from, it is advisable to ensure that the state has been fully cleared down.

- Run `terraform destroy`

- Once that's complete run:

```bash
rm -rf .terraform
```
- And then run:

```bash
rm -rf terraform.tfstate*
```

### My terraform apply seems to be stuck, what should I do?

Sometimes the terraform apply can intermittently hang when trying to setup your kubectl config. You'll see this because it will take over 20 mins to create the cluster and keep repeating the same step that it is waiting for. 

If you do experience this then simply hit Ctrl + C (to cancel the run) and then **re-run** `terraform apply` - it should identify that much of the items have been created and finish off with updating your kubeconfig.

---

### Where do I run the `terraform destroy` command?

- You need to run the `terraform destroy` command from the location where your terraform config is

## Argo

### Iâ€™m getting invalid password/username when trying to log into Argo. Has anyone else had this?

- The instructions mentioned that the first password may fail. We recommend you try a different command to get a different password. The second one usually works (make sure you remove the % character at the end if it's there).
